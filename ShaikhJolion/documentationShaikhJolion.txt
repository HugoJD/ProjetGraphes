NAME
    ShaikhJolion

DESCRIPTION
	ShaikhJolion.py is an algorithm that consists of modifying the minimum of 
	edges (add or deleting) so that from an undated, unweighted graph with 
	edges between certain vertices (2 vertices are considered "similar" if they 
	have an edge between them, "not similar" otherwise), the result is a 
	cluster graph, i.e. a collection of cliques.
	The main idea of our algorithm is to choose the vertice of the highest degree 
	and form a clique bringing together top as well as all its neighbors. 
	We then remove the edges involved in the created clique, and renew the process, 
	until all the commits of the original graph belong to a clique.

FUNCTIONS
    DegreSommet(Graphe)
        Function that gives the list of vertices with their degree

    UnionClique(Graphe)
	Function of changing the minimum of edges and having 
	a set of cliques from an undirected, unweighted graph

    ajoutArete(Graphe, u, v)
	Function to add an edge between two given peaks

    creerClique(Graphe, u, ListeEdition, Explore)
	Function to create a click from a given vertice

    degreMax(ListeDegre)
	Function to have the vertice with the greatest degree

    grapheSansClique(Graphe, ListeEdition, Explore)
        Function that removes all the vertices belonging to 
	a click from a given graph in settings (list Explore)

    supprimerArete(Graphe, u, v)
    	Function that removes a given edge
