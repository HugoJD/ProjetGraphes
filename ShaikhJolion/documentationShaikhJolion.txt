Help on module ShaikhJolion

NAME
    solution

DESCRIPTION
	ShaikhJolion.py is an algorithm that consists of modifying the minimum of 
	edges (add or deleting) so that from an undated, unweighted graph with 
	edges between certain peaks (2 peaks are considered "similar" if they 
	have an edge between them, "not similar" otherwise), the result is a 
	cluster graph, i.e. a collection of clicks

FUNCTIONS
    DegreSommet(Graphe)
        Function that gives the list of vertices with their degree

    UnionClique(Graphe)
	Function of changing the minimum of edges and having 
	a set of clicks from an undirected, unweighted graph

    ajoutArete(Graphe, u, v)
	Function to add an edge between two given peaks

    creerClique(Graphe, u, ListeEdition, Explore)
	Feature to create a click from a given vertice

    degreMax(ListeDegre)
	Function to have the vertice with the greatest degree

    grapheSansClique(Graphe, ListeEdition, Explore)
        Function that removes all the vertices belonging to 
	a click from a given graph in settings (list Explore)

    supprimerArete(Graphe, u, v)
    ListeEdition = []
    line = '\n'
